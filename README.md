# Car-profiles-classifier
This is a multi label classification problem where I try to classify different profiles of cars. 
The classes are as follows:
1. Front
2. Rear
3. Left
4. Right

One might wonder how is it a multi-label classification problem!

Have a look at this image

This image contains both the Front and the Right profile of car.
